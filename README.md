# CPU Scheduling Simulator

This project is a Java-based CPU Scheduling Simulator that implements four scheduling algorithms: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest-Job-First (SJF), Shortest-Remaining-Time (SRT), and Round Robin (RR). The program features a menu-driven interface, allowing users to select an algorithm, input process details, and view the Gantt chart, waiting times, turnaround times, and average metrics.

## Features
- Menu-driven interface with options for FCFS, SJF, SRT, RR, and exit.
- Input validation for process details (e.g., non-negative arrival times, positive burst times).
- Displays a Gantt chart and detailed results for each algorithm.
- Well-commented code explaining key logic and functions.

## Prerequisites
To run this program, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher (e.g., OpenJDK or Oracle JDK).
- **Git**: To clone the repository (optional if downloading manually).
- A terminal or IDE (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA) to compile and run the code.
